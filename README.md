# reverse-string-technical-interview

This repository contains 5 different ways to reverse a string in Python, along with unit tests and performance evaluations for each method.

## Methods:

1. Using Slicing: The time complexity of this method is O(n).
2. Using Join and Reversed: The time complexity of this method is O(n).
3. Using For Loop: The time complexity of this method is O(n).
4. Using Recursion: The time complexity of this method is O(n).
5. Using While Loop: The time complexity of this method is O(n).

## Requirements:

1. Python 3.6 or newer

## How to run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.
3. Run the following command from the main directory to run the script:
   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```
4. Enter the string to be reversed.
5. The reversed string will be printed as well as the performance evaluation.
6. Run the following command from the main directory to run all unit tests:
   ```
   python3 -m unittest
   ```
   Note: to run individual unit tests, run the following command:
   ```
   python3 -m unittest tests.<test_file_name>
   ```
   where `<test_file_name>` is the name of the test file without the `.py` extension.
